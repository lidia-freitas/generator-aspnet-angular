> Asp.Net Project With AngularJS (Based on angular generator)
> A Fork of [AngularJS Generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) from the Yeoman team

## Requirements
* Visual Studio with .NET Framework 4.5.2
* Node.js
* Ruby SASS

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-aspnet-angular using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-aspnet-angular
```
Then, on Visual Studio, create a new ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) and
Select the template as follows:

Then generate your new project from your ASP.NET Project folder:

```bash
yo aspnet-angular
```
This generator is based on official [yeoman angular-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular), so the entire front-end structure will be created 
inside of your ASP.NET project folder.

This generator will also modify some files in your ASP.NET project like 'web.config' and 'RouteConfig.cs' from App_Start folder, 
and create some others like Views and Controllers.

Before run your application in Visual Studio, remember to include this newly created Views and Controllers files in your project: 
From Solution explorer sidebar mark 'Show all Files' option:

Then right click on hidden files and choose 'Include In Project' option:

## Front-End Development workflow
To create and edit the screens of your application, isn't necessary run your project from Visual Studio.
To take advantage of all the features of the front-end development process like pre-processing css, javascript lint, livereload and package management 
you must open project's folder from your command line tool and run:
 ```bash
 grunt serve
 ```
